The files in this archive have three extensions:
1. *.plain // for a simple input file of various lengths
           // NOTE that there are NO carriage returns, line feeds, or
	   // newline characters in these files.
2. *.crc   // the corresponding CRC file for its "plain" input
3. And the README.txt file - which you are reading now...

The files with the CRC extension have a valid CRC with ONE
EXCEPTION - WS-BOGUS.crc which has an invalid CRC (for WS.plain).

In the event that you'd like to change input data or the calculated CRC
to something that is appropriately valid or invalid, REMEMBER to use
a simple TEXT editor, such as Notepad, Notepad++, VIM, EMACS, or gedit,
to modify the file's content.
