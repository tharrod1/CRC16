The files in this archive have three extensions:
1. *.plain // for a simple input file of various lengths
           // NOTE that there are NO carriage returns, line feeds, or
	   // newline characters in these files.
2. *.crc   // the corresponding CRC file for its "plain" input
3. And the README.txt file - which you are reading now...

The files with the CRC extension have a valid CRC with ONE
EXCEPTION - WS-BOGUS.crc which has an invalid CRC (for WS.plain).
